# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Forked and customized Alex Kallaway's 100 Days of Code repo to my liking.

**Thoughts**: Markdown is cool! I should continue getting familiar with Markdown so that I can write better README.md and other .md files on Github.
