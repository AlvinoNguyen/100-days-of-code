# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: January 1, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Forked and customized Alex Kallaway's 100 Days of Code repo to my liking.

**Thoughts**: Markdown is cool! I should continue getting familiar with Markdown so that I can write better README.md and other .md files on Github.

### Day 2: January 2, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Started building a tribute page according to the user stories specified by freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: I am rusty on pure HTML and CSS, so it will take me a few projects in order to get used to working with these two web technologies again. Luckily, there are many pure HTML and CSS projects on freeCodeCamp!

### Day 3: January 3, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Finished the tribute page, and created the skeleton code for the survey form according to the user stories specified by freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts**: The most challenging part of HTML and CSS is that you don't receive any explicit errors. This makes it hard to detect nuances in your code, especially in CSS. Also, I think I have a gap in my learning when it comes to HTML forms! I'll have to find tutorials in order to catch up and continue working tomorrow.

### Day 4: January 4, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Added new types of input to the survey form, including a dropdown, radio buttons, checkboxes, and a text area. Also added basic styling to the form.

**Thoughts**: There was not as much progress as I wanted today. I got a bit lazy during the middle of the day, and therefore didn't get to coding until the evening. However, I did get a lot of coding done because I also coded for my work today. However, according to the [rules](rules.md), if I code at work, that time won't count towards the challenge.
