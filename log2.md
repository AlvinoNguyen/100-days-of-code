# 100 Days Of Code - Log 2

### Day 1: November 1, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Pulled from Alex Kallaway's original 100 Days of Code repo. Added `README.md` to Github profile.

**Thoughts**: Welcome back! I have decided to go for another 100 Days of Code round in order to motivate myself to work on my professional development, which is the theme of the next 100 days. Therefore, I'm gonna modify some rules to fit my goals. First, I don't necessarily have to code every day, but I have to log every day, and I'd better be doing something CS-related every day that is moving me towards a career in computer science. Today, that happened to be working on my GitHub profile. It turns out you can feature a `README` page on your your GitHub profile! I know right?

### Day 2: November 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the basics of Python. Forked MCsniperPY, and partially refactored code in fork.

**Thoughts**: I spent part of my morning skimming and taking light notes on the official Python documentation tutorials, which I think should give me a good feel for the structure and best practices of Python programs. I immediately put it into practice by forking MCsniperPY, a python-based open-source Minecraft name sniper that's in desperate need of refactoring. This might not be the best use of my hour of code, but I'm glad to find a way apply my recreational life to my professional one. Plus, I wanna boost my GitHub statistics, and I have a shortage of pull requests, issues, and contributions!

### Day 3: November 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More refactoring code in MCsniperPY fork.

**Thoughts**: Today's progress was similar to yesterday, so I'm still being productive in my opinion. However, my 100 Days of Code could drag if I let this be the only project that I work on, so tomorrow, I want to try to start on a new personal project. I won't make any promises though, since it's midterm season, and I'm pretty busy.

### Day 4: November 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Looked into Mojang API change.

**Thoughts**: I tried running MCsniperPY today when it gave me a bug I'd never seen before. I started my own name sniping program and found the same error. A bit of experimenting led me to believe that Mojang made a change to the 'GET players' API. I tried a for a little, but I couldn't find a workaround, which was a shame since this would have been a good excuse to put in a pull request. Maybe I could create an issue and improve my issue counts instead. Is a lot of excuses a good thing?

### Day 5: November 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Interviewed for a Humana Tech internship.

**Thoughts**: Today, I had an interview at 4:30 pm for Humana. Although I'm not too optimistic on how I did during the half hour, I can still be proud that I made the interview happen by applying for internships in my free time. Unfortunately, I don't think I'm getting a response from the other places I applied to, so it might be time to start applying again. Also, I should practice getting interviewed as well.

### Day 6: November 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: More refactoring code in MCsniperPY fork.

**Thoughts**: Not much to say today... It was pretty easy work similar to what I was doing a few days ago. I think I'll be ready to create a pull request for my changes by the end of the weekend.
