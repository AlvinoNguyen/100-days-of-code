# 100 Days Of Code - Log 2

### Day 1: November 1, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Pulled from Alex Kallaway's original 100 Days of Code repo. Added `README.md` to Github profile.

**Thoughts**: Welcome back! I have decided to go for another 100 Days of Code round in order to motivate myself to work on my professional development, which is the theme of the next 100 days. Therefore, I'm gonna modify some rules to fit my goals. First, I don't necessarily have to code every day, but I have to log every day, and I'd better be doing something CS-related every day that is moving me towards a career in computer science. Today, that happened to be working on my GitHub profile. It turns out you can feature a `README` page on your your GitHub profile! I know right?

### Day 2: November 2, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Reviewed the basics of Python. Forked MCsniperPY, and partially refactored code in fork.

**Thoughts**: I spent part of my morning skimming and taking light notes on the official Python documentation tutorials, which I think should give me a good feel for the structure and best practices of Python programs. I immediately put it into practice by forking MCsniperPY, a python-based open-source Minecraft name sniper that's in desperate need of refactoring. This might not be the best use of my hour of code, but I'm glad to find a way apply my recreational life to my professional one. Plus, I wanna boost my GitHub statistics, and I have a shortage of pull requests, issues, and contributions!

### Day 3: November 3, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: More refactoring code in MCsniperPY fork.

**Thoughts**: Today's progress was similar to yesterday, so I'm still being productive in my opinion. However, my 100 Days of Code could drag if I let this be the only project that I work on, so tomorrow, I want to try to start on a new personal project. I won't make any promises though, since it's midterm season, and I'm pretty busy.

### Day 4: November 4, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Looked into Mojang API change.

**Thoughts**: I tried running MCsniperPY today when it gave me a bug I'd never seen before. I started my own name sniping program and found the same error. A bit of experimenting led me to believe that Mojang made a change to the 'GET players' API. I tried a for a little, but I couldn't find a workaround, which was a shame since this would have been a good excuse to put in a pull request. Maybe I could create an issue and improve my issue counts instead. Is a lot of excuses a good thing?

### Day 5: November 5, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Interviewed for a Humana Tech internship.

**Thoughts**: Today, I had an interview at 4:30 pm for Humana. Although I'm not too optimistic on how I did during the half hour, I can still be proud that I made the interview happen by applying for internships in my free time. Unfortunately, I don't think I'm getting a response from the other places I applied to, so it might be time to start applying again. Also, I should practice getting interviewed as well.

### Day 6: November 6, Friday

**Today's Progress**: More refactoring code in MCsniperPY fork.

**Thoughts**: Not much to say today... It was pretty easy work similar to what I was doing a few days ago. I think I'll be ready to create a pull request for my changes by the end of the weekend.

### Day 7: November 8, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: More refactoring code in MCsniperPY fork. Looked a bit into Github issues and pull requests.

**Thoughts**: Unfortunately, I didn't log yesterday, so I'm gonna make the rules a bit more leniant to allow myself to continue the challenge. Now, I'm not allowed to miss two days in a row. I'm gonna suggest that the day after a missed entry, I should work for at least two hours to make up for the skipped entry. Anyway, today was jsut some more code refactoring. I think I'm at the point where I can submit a pull request, but I wanna make sure I know the in's and out's of issues and pull requests before I go and embarass myself. It seems pretty straightforward from what I've read, so let's submit that PR tomorrow!

### Day 8: November 10, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: Took notes on Github issues and pull requests.

**Thoughts**: No coding today, however, I'm sure the notes I took today will pay off later when I'm a software engineer using Github to contribute to big projects. I wish I had submitted my pull request for McsniperPY today, but it's super late at this point, so I plan on posting it tomorrow. No promises though; this week has been super busy for me!

### Day 9: November 12, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: Created a pull request on [Kqzz/MCsniperPY](https://github.com/Kqzz/MCsniperPY). Also added user replies for pull requests and issues.

**Thoughts**: Again, no coding today, but this was also my first day submitting a pull request for an open-source project, so that's good! I don't think my pull request will be reviewed though, so it mgiht be time to move onto something else. In the meantime, I added reply shortcuts to my Github profile. The point is to semi-automate Github posts and comments, and I created a template for pull requests and issues. Those should come in handy in the future, right?

### Day 10: November 14, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: Started looking into tutorials on creating Discord and Telegram bots.

**Thoughts**: I don't know what suddenly made me interested in bots, but I really wanna make one! Luckily, both Discord and Telegram bots can be created using Node. I'm a bit disappointed that it took this long for me to start up a project, but hey, better late than never. so far, the plan is to start off with a light-hearted Telegram bot to put in my friends' group chat, and then create a more practical bot for Discord. Let's see where this goes!

### Day 11: November 16, Monday

**Today's Progress**: Initalized the Telegram bot repository and added starter code to the project.

**Thoughts**: Today was big milestone for me professionally. I got my first software engineering internship offer! Honestly, I didn't expect to get it one so soon, which is why I started up this challenge again, but I'm glad I did, since it takes a lot of stress off my back... for now at least. However, I've already committed myself to this, so I'm gonna keep going!

A combination of prior Node knowledge and prior reading of documentation is gonna make this project go by really fast. I spent about half an hour setting the entire project up, and spent the other half hour experimenting with the API. Everything is really straightforward, and it doesn't look like I'll run into many major problems. Looks like I'll have to come up with a new project idea sooner than I thought!

### Day 12: November 18, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: Added five new event branches to the Telegram bot.

**Thoughts**: Today was pretty casual; it was a lot of API documentation reading and experimenting, and everything is still pretty straightforward. In fact, it's so straightforward that it's probably time to move onto another project... or at least start on the Discord bot.

### Day 13: November 20, Friday

**Today's Progress**: Added the ShrekLitoris event handler to the Telegram bot.

**Thoughts**: Again, today was casual. I'm starting to feel like I'm getting really lazy with this 100 Days of Code challenege, so I'm gonna try to set aside some time during the day to code. Hopefully, I begin to start writing more meaningful code.

### Day 13: November 22, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Thought of new bot ideas.

**Thoughts**: Today, I attempted to implement something new for my Telegram bot, but I was running low on new ideas. It seems like I've already done all of the hard coding work, and all I need to do now is think of inside jokes to insert into the code, and that's not necessarily helping me get more familiar with Node. Therefore, I spent today thinking about ideas for practical bots for Telegram. I settled on an idea that I plan to implement tomorrow, but I'll keep it a secret for now.
