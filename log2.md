# 100 Days Of Code - Log 2

### Day 1: November 1, Sunday

**Today's Progress**: Pulled from Alex Kallaway's original 100 Days of Code repo. Added `README.md` to Github profile.

**Thoughts**: Welcome back! I have decided to go for another 100 Days of Code round in order to motivate myself to work on my professional development, which is the theme of the next 100 days. Therefore, I'm gonna modify some rules to fit my goals. First, I don't necessarily have to code every day, but I have to log every day, and I'd better be doing something CS-related every day that is moving me towards a career in computer science. Today, that happened to be working on my GitHub profile. It turns out you can feature a `README` page on your your GitHub profile! I know right?
